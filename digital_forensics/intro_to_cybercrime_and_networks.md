INTRODUCTION TO CYBERCRIME AND NETWORKS
    Cybercrime:
        -Is a crime conducted via the internet or other computer network
        
    Computer Crime:
        - Is a crime involving computers (digital devices) where the computer is a tool or a victim

Devices communicate with each other using the TCP/IP protocol.

IP address:
    - Is a unique identifier for a device connected to the internet
    - ISPs are responsible for distributing IP addresses

How connections can be made:
    - When a device is online, anyone across the world (connected to the internet) can connect to its (public) IP address
    - The device's security settings determine how the device responds to different connections
    - Programs running on the computer can create loop holes on the network
    - Keeping software updated help close vulnerabilities

Forms of cybercrimes:
    - Attacker may try to steal data or information stored on a computer
    - Attacker may steal data or information transferred over a network
    - Attacker may take control of devices and use their resources (network, hard drive, processor) to do what they want

International component of cybercrimes:
    - Real-time connections globally
    - Suspect-victim-servers in same country
    - Suspect in another country, victim-servers in same country
    - Suspect-victim in same country, servers in another country
    - Suspect and Victim and servers are all in different countries

Police intervention are limited by jurisdiction
    - Law Enforcements have a specific jurisdiction that they have authority in
    - They cannot:
        > Carry out any official investigation outside their jurisdiction
        > Make arrests outside their jurisdiction
        > Collect evidence outside their jurisdiction
    - Cross-jurisdiction requires country to country cooperation

Nature of a cybercrime:
    - Often start with a victim
        > Connections made to victim's device
        > (Usually) where money was transferred to
    - Following money transfers, phone calls, SMS, and IP addresses can give leads to an investigator
    - Investigations leading outside the country become much more difficult
