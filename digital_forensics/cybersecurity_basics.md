CYBER SECURITY
    - Protects networks, computer programs and data from attack, damage or unauthorized access.
    - Mitigates the balance between openness and level of risk
    - Reduces easy access on demand for people.

CIA Model (cybersecurity model)
    - Confidentiality: 
        Only those with access can access sensitive information
    - Integrity:
        Maintaining the consistency, accuracy and trustworthiness of data over its life cycle
    - Availability:
        Those who should have access can access data whenever they want it.

Data: 
    - CIA applies to data / information that is in storage or in transit
    - The lifecycle of the data describes its use from the time it is created to the time it is deleted

Risks to:
    1. Confidentiality:
        - Exposing information meant to be kept private, example: credit card number, trade secrets and others
    2. Integrity:
        - Altering information flow (changing receiver account during a transaction)
        - Using a virus to modify data of a competitor
    3. Availability
        - DDoS attacks
        - Cryptolocker blocking access to data on hard drives (solution is having a back up for the data)

Cyber Security focuses on protecting:
    1. Confidentiality:
        - Through identification of an object or person
            > Access Control Lists
            > Data encrption
            > IDs and Passwords
            > Biometrics

    2. Integrity:
        - Through change detection and backups
            > Checksums
            > Data backup (multiple, offsite, etc.)
        - Integrity should be maintained while data is stored (not very difficult) and while in transit (can be very difficult)

    3. Availability:
        - Through hardware duplicates and updated software
            > Ensure hardware is in working order Upgrade all system software
            > COngure redundancy (failover, load balancing, RAID, clusters)
            > Consider disaster recovery (what if the building is destroyed?)
            > Consider software based solutions (DoS prevention / Firewall)

Attack focuses:
    - Systems with almost no security configured
    - High-profile systems
        > Potentially a lot of money
        > Potentially a lot of fame

    - Computers on the internet are vulnerable to attacks from viruses or bots (automated systems that track vulnerable systems on the network)

Basic level of cyber security:
    1. Update software (all) otherwise outdated software will be vulnerable to cyber attacks
    2. Access Controls-restricted accounts
        > Reduce access rights for accounts you use
        > Require passwords for the administrator account
    3. If device needs direct access to the internet
        > Set up a Firewall/ Proxy/ Secure Gateway
    4. Check logs often
        > Any strange logins
        > Any strange connections or errors
    5. Anti-virus
        > Most systems should have an installed and updated anti-virus (or two)
        > Use a regional (V3-korea specific anti-virus) and global (Avira) anti=virus for better protection
    6. Don't use secure systems to visit unknown or unrelated websites
        > Many current attacks focus on compromise of the browser
        > Always use the newest, updated browser
            * Do not use Internet explorer (whose current version is microsoft edge)
            * Google Chrome (automatically updates)
            * Mozilla Firefox
